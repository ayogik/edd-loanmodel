        <h1>The Student Loan Debt Crisis</h1>
        <p>The student loan debt crisis is an ever-growing concern in the eyes of experts across the world. Currently, student loan debt is accruing more than mortgage debt and sits second to only mortgage debt in terms of sheer volume, well ahead of both credit cards and auto loans. Former students across the country, over $44 million of them, are facing incredible pressures from burdensome student loans that have accumulated over time due to their high interest rates and rising delinquency rates. Now valued at $1.5 trillion dollars, and increasing at a rate of $29 billion per month, the concerns posed by student loans reach as far as excessive long-term stagnation in the economy, with those in the demographic acting as a leading cause in the declining home-ownership and continually increasing default rates propelling a rise in unemployment. However, certain aspects of the crisis itself that remain shadowed by bigger numbers hide the true underlying concerns of economists. For example, more than half of college students take more than four years to graduate from college, thus leading to increased loan payments due to forbearance. </p>

        <p>As an entire economy, the delinquency rate on 90+ day delinquent loans is 11.4%, while the net delinquency for direct loans cumulative in default for over 360+ days is $101.4 billion, totalled by nearly 5.1 million borrowers. Under the age of 39, there are approximately 29 million borrowers, representative of 65% of all student loan borrowers. Another driving issue is the transition from private loans into government sponsored, public loans, putting the government in the driverâ€™s seat but also holding the economy back on a grander scale. Private loan volume peaked at $18.1 billion in 2007-2008 and is now situated at $7.8 billion as of 2014-2015. The scariest portion of it all is that nearly 68% of all seniors graduating from public and non-profit institutions in 2015 had student loan debt, with the average debt hovering around $30,000 as well, numbers that many do not expect to improve very soon. </p>
